Marine Chemistry and Oceaongraphy
---
**Supervised by Dr. Emily Bockmon

In Dr. Bockmon's marine chemistry and oceaongraphy laboratory we sample and analyze the local waters including, but not limited to, Avila Beach and Morro Bay. We conducted routine analysis monitering the pH, alkalinity, and dissolved inorganic carbon of the seawater samples. I am one of the pH technicians for Dr. Bockmon responsible for sample handling and scheduling, routine maintience of spectrophotometer equipment, and pH data analysis. I have been working for Dr. Bockmon since June 2021. 


Ogranic Synthesis Laboratory
---
**Supervised by Dr. Phil Costanzo

Dr. Costanzo runs the organic synthesis laboratory with a focus on polymer chemistry. I am apart of a sub group ATRP which stands for Atom Transfer free-Radical Polymerization where we are tasked with synthesizing a polymer from butanol fulvene. So far I have been trained on air-free techniques for synthesis reactions, purging, weigh by addition, and various work-up techniques including back-extraction. I have been trained on 300 & 400 MHz NMR and GPC.
